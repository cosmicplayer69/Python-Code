answer:-  reCAPTCHA, AmazonCE 

2. List Python Libraries Used in Different IT Domains
answer:-  numpy, pandas, matplotlib .

3. Write Down difference between interpreter and compiler 
answer:-   Compiler scans the entire block of code at once whereas interpreter scans one statement at a time. 

4. What is Data Structure, why we need one in programs?  
answer:-  Data structures are the main structures which are used in enhancing computer science algorithms. We need data structures 
          as they play an important role in enhancing the program data and it can be accessed while working effeciently. 

Create a list data type and store names of your friends in it (at least 5), check out what are methods available in 
           Names = ['Mahesh', 'Aryaman', 'Rohit', 'Rahul', 'Sahil']

5. list data type, try to figure out their working using help function in python. 
answer:-  Some of the datatypes are string (str), integer (int), boolean and float
          str='I am new to Python'
          a=5;

6. What is difference between ordered data type and unordered data type?  
answer:-  Ordered dataype guarantees the specified order in which it is initialized. for eg. string, tuple, list.
          Unordered datatype cannot maintain the specified order when they are run. for eg. sets and dictionaries.

7. Write down types of each value given? ( in python) 
	100 - integer
	105.5 - float
	192.56j - complex	 
	10+6j  - 
	‘10’  - tuple
	‘hello world’ - string
	[ 10, 20, 50, 100] - list
	{ ‘name’: ‘sachin’, ‘age’: 24, ‘language’: ‘python’ } - dictionary

8. Explore split, strip, replace, center, title methods of string data type in python 
answer:-  stay = 'good morning'
          stay.split()  will give you ['good', 'morning']

          txt = "I like baseball"
          x = txt.replace("baseball", "cricket")
          print(x)

          txt = "     baseball     "
          x = txt.strip()
          print("of all sports", x, "is my favorite")

          txt = "baseball"
          x = txt.center(30)       #it will keep the word baseball in the center of 30 spaces.
          print(x)

          txt = "Welcome to my world"
          x = txt.title()                   #it will print the following text on the title.
          print(x)

9. Explore append, pop, remove, sort methods of list data type
answer:-   list.append(x):- adds an item to the end of the list.
           list.pop([x]):- removes the item from a specified position in the list.
           list.remove(x):- removes the first item in the list.
           list.sort(x):- sorts the items in a specified order.

10. Create 5 real time list to store some useful information in python eg. Language = [ ‘java’, ‘c’, ‘c++’, ‘ruby’] 
answer:- l1 = ['apple', 'ball', 'cat', 'dog', 'elephant']
         l2 = ['doctor', 'engineer', 'lawyer', 'accountant']
         l3 = ['mechanical', 'civil', 'cse']
         l4 = ['amity', 'LPU']
         l5 = ['stage', 'audience']

11. What is difference between mutable and immutable data types in python
answer:-  The mutable datatypes can change the value without adding any new object. for eg. lists and dictionaries
          whereas immutable datatypes cannot change the values of objects once its created. for eg. integers, boolean, string.
12. What are identifiers, list rules of identifiers in python 
answer:-  Identifiers are used to identify certain variables , function, classes etc. the rules are:- 
          1). It cannot start with a digit
          2). Keywords cannot be used as identifiers
          3). The use of special symbols is forbidden
          4). underscore(_) can be used in the identifiers
          5). it should start with a Capital letter.

13. What is type casting?
asnwer:-  Type casting is a method used to change the variables declared in a certain data type into a different data 
          type to match the operation required to be performed by the block of code statements. for eg. str() , int() , float().

14. What are operators? How many types of operators are there in python? 
answer:-  operators are certain symbols which perform certain operation on one or more than one operands in an equation. Python 
          has 7 operators:- 
          1).Arithmetic operator
          2).Logical operator
          3).Relational operator
          4).Assignment operator
          5).Membership operator
          6).Bitwise operator
          7).Identity operator

16. What do the following expressions evaluate to? 

	a. 'Hello world!'[1] - 'e'
	b. 'Hello world!'[0:5] - Hello 
	c. 'Hello world!'[:5]  - 'Hello'
	d. 'Hello world!'[3:] - 'lo world'

17. What do the following expressions evaluate to? 
	a. 'Hello'.upper() - UPPER 
	b. 'Hello'.upper().isupper() - true 
	c. 'Hello'.upper().lower() - hello 

18. What do the following expressions evaluate to? 
	a. 'Remember, remember, the fifth of November.'.split()

    answer:- ['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'November.']
